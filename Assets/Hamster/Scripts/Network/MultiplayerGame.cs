/*
 * Note: Although it would be cleaner if this was a separate GameObject than NetworkManager, the way Unity works makes that more trouble than it's worth. Because the NetworkManager
 * is set to DontDestroyOnLoad, it gets put into a separate kind of scene than the other objects. They are separated such that one cannot refer to the other. Since MultiplayerGame needs to
 * refer to NetworkManager, that makes that structure a no-go. Thus, it's simply placed as a component onto the same Component as CustomNetworkManager. It's unclear what ramifications this may
 * have later down the road. But for now, it works.
