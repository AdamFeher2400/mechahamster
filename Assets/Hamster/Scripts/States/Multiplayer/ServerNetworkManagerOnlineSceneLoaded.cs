/*
 *  Unity has two scenes to load when creating a networked game.
 *  1) what they call "Offline scene" - I use NetworkStartScene.unity
 *  2) what they call "Online scene" - I use NetworkMainGameScene.unity.
 *  After #2 is loaded, all of the various prefabs and objects that are in that scene are ready to use.
 *  Before #2 is loaded, we can use the data in the objects in the scene, but they will be destroyed before #2 is loaded! So we must wait for #2 to load before we can do many things
 *  like load the appropriate level on the server.
